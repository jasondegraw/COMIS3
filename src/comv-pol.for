C	This version is a merged version from LBL and empa in jun1992.

C
C      Items to be improved or reviewed are marked with 'C!!' in the
C      first three coloumns.
C
C      Changes:
C@empa aw 1993mar09 save concentrations from the last calculation in Cold
C@empa aw 1993mar11 preset Cold with zeros
C@empa aw 1994oct31 Timesteps changed to 1 when DeltaT is 0 in order to have
C@                  one call to PolTrans for calculating the steady state
C@                  solution.
C@empa aw 1994
C@empa rs dec1994   pollutant concentration gradients in layered zones and
C		    pollutant transport through large openings: a new factor
C		    Ffactl(2,MaxL) is introduced to replace the massflow array
C		    fv2(2,MaxL). For LVO Ffactl is the integral of massflow
C		    times the relative "from-zone" concentration c(z)/c(0)
C		    over the opening, for other links Ffactl is fv2*c(z)/c(0).
C		    Ffactl is calculated with a new function FFACT which
C		    calls a new subroutine FMAPROFCAL for calculation of
C		    the massflow and height profile through a LVO.
C		    The relative zone concentration c(z)/c(0) is calculated
C		    with a new function PROFCALZ.
C
C@empa rs dec1994   a consistent application of the definition of pollutant
C		    concentration as mass of pollutant in a certain volume
C		    of polluted air per mass of dry and clean air in the same
C		    volume of polluted air leads to new factors for the
C		    pollutant mass transported through a link (Efactz(MaxZ),
C		    Efactext(MaxW),Efactext0) and for the total mass of
C                   pollutant in the zone volume(Dfactz(MaxZ)). These factors
C		    are updated after each internal timestep. They are
C		    calculated with functions EFACT and DFACT. The densities
C		    are not needed anymore.
C@NBI PGS 2000Oct31 - Eh? The above method is flawed : The definition should be
C@NBI                 the mass of a pollutant in a certain volume of polluted air
C@NBI                 per mass DRY POLLUTED air in the same volume.  This is due
C@NBI                 to three reasons:
C@NBI                 (1) Concentration can never exceed 100% (or 1 million ppm)
C@NBI                     but the above method lets this happen !
C@NBI                 (2) Many so-called "pollutants" that are simuated in COMIS
C@NBI                     are natural constituents of dry clean air (eg. CO2,O2).
C@NBI                     Air is 21% O2, so it is meaningless to calculate O2
C@NBI                     concentration as a fraction of the remaining 79%.
C@NBI                 (3) If a pollutant is called "H2O" then COMIS would be
C@NBI                     subtracting it twice from the mass of air in the room
C@NBI                     to find the mass of dry air!  This is an artefact of
C@NBI                     the way COMIS is programmed to handle humidity.
C@NBI               - The functions EFACT and DFACT have therefore been replaced
C@NBI                 by simple in-line code, and are thus redundant.
C@empa aw 2000dec12 We keep the original definition. Peter, see my mail from 12.12.2000
C@empa rs dec1994   zones with volume 0 are not taken into account for
C		    calculation of the timestep for the internal timeloop.
C@empa rs dec1994   b(MaxC,MaxZ) has been redimensioned to b(MaxZ)
C@empa rs dec1994   the diagonal elements a(i,i) are now calculated with the
C		    total mass of outflowing polluted air instead of the total
C		    mass of inflowing polluted air.
C		    The case a(i,i)=0 (possible for steady state calculation
C		    or zone volume 0) could not be solved. Now for the case
C		    b(i)=0 the solution is c(t+dt) = c(t). For b(i)>0 there is
C		    no solution.
C@empa rs dec1994   the reactivity rk is now defined by the pollutant mass
C		    balance:
C				dm(poll)/dt=-rk*m(poll)
C		    rk is defined as a zone independent property of each
C		    pollutant, e.g. a radioactive decay constant: rk(MaxC).
C		    In addition a zone- and pollutant specific reactivity
C		    rkz(MaxC,MaxZ) is defined to describe processes like
C		    adsorption. rkz can be explicit CIF-input or if there
C		    is an adsorption model rkz can be calculated and updated
C		    after each internal timestep.
C@empa rs dec1994   cm(j) is initialized with the concentrations from the
C		    preceding timestep, before GSSOLV is called.
C@NBI PGS 1999Aug10 - Had to change name of variable 'Interval' to 'DeltaT',
C@NBI                 to avoid confusion with the variable 'Interval'

C@lbl bvs 1999Jun01 moved rk(maxc) to global area and added code in
C	comv-inp.inc so users can use the decay term for pollutants
C Local
C@empa rs 1994dec09 new definition of reactivity as pollutant specific
C		    decay constant, assuming exponential
C                   (e.g. radioactive) decay. Redimensioned rk:
C                   rk(maxc). Rkmax: maximum of all rk(i)
C                   In addition to rk(maxc) a pollutant- and zone-specific
C		    reactivity rkz(maxc,maxz) is introduced for modelling of
C		    effects like: adsorption, chemical decay depending on
C		    zone properties (e.g. temperature, humidity) or similar
C 		    mechanisms. As for rk(polnr) for rkz(polnr,zonenr) it is
C		    assumed that the total loss of pollutant in a zone per
C		    timestep is proportional to the product of rk or rkz and
C		    the actual mass m of pollutant in the zone (which is
C		    portional to the zone concentration of the pollutant):
C                   dm / dt = - m * ( rk(polnr) + rkz(polnr,zonenr) )
C		    If an adsorption model is introduced, rkz can be
C		    calculated from e.g. wallproperties instead of being
C		    explicit CIF-input. Taking into account the dependence of
C		    rkz from the history of the adsorbing system, rkz has to
C                   be updated after each internal timestep (only if not
C		    explicit CIF-input).
C		    rkmaxz: maximum of all rkz(i,j).

C
C	Be careful!!! When xnp1(i) is going below zero, the b term in this

C       I think this is o.k., because the difference between xnp1 and xn
C       is small enough ( the number of timesteps depends on the tau value).
C       If the concentrations for each room is less than 1e-30, the solution is

C       It is still possible, that a underflow warning could occur. But this is

C***********************************************************************
C       EMPA rs 1994dec15
C
C  THIS ROUTINE IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ROUTINE VERTICOP !
C
C Purpose: This subroutine calculates the massflow profile fmaprof
C          and the height profile hghtprof for the LVO with linknr
C          actlnr. The heights hghtprof(1,i) are calculated relative
C          to reference height of the FROM-zone, hghtprof(2,i)
C                relative to reference height of the TO-zone.
C          Dpref is the pressure difference at reference height.
C
C Changes:
C@NBI PGS 1999Aug10 - Had to change name of variable 'Interval' to 'DeltaZ',
C@NBI                 to avoid confusion with the variable 'Interval'
C@NBI                 (i.e. schedule deltaT) in the INCLUDE file.
C@NBI PGS 2003Apr30 - Bugfix: This code was using wrong definition of
C@NBI                 opening factors "Cfact" for LVO type 2:
C@NBI                 Cfact is 1.0 when opening angle is 90
C@NBI PGS 2003Apr30 - Replaced calculation routine for LVO2 opening, more
C@NBI                 accurate at all opening angles, especially small
C@NBI                 angles (no discretization error for opening area).
C@NBI               - Also tidied up the code (no syntax change apart from LVO2).
C@empa aw 2005jun01 - LVO2 according to old geometry
C@empa aw 2005jun01 - New LVO3: Horizontal pivoting axis according to geometry from PGS 
C@empa aw 2005jun01 - New LVO4 and LVO5: Triangles with vertex at the bottom and at the top
